Ruby on Rails, often simply called Rails, is a popular web application framework written in the Ruby programming language. It is designed to make web development easier and faster by providing a structure for the database, web services, and web pages.

## Key Features of Ruby on Rails

*   **Convention over Configuration:** Rails promotes the principle of "convention over configuration," meaning developers spend less time configuring files and more time writing code. Rails has default ways to do things.

*   **Model-View-Controller (MVC) Architecture:** Rails follows the MVC architectural pattern, which separates the application into three interconnected parts:
    *   **Model:** Represents the data and business logic.
    *   **View:** Handles the presentation of data to the user.
    *   **Controller:** Manages the interaction between the Model and the View.

*   **Active Record ORM:** Rails includes Active Record, an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) system that simplifies database interactions.  Active Record allows you to interact with databases using Ruby code instead of writing raw SQL queries.

*   **RESTful Routes:** Rails encourages the use of RESTful architecture, which provides a standardized way to map HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to controller actions.

*   **Scaffolding:** Rails provides scaffolding tools that can automatically generate basic code for models, views, and controllers, speeding up the initial development process.

*   **Testing Framework:** Rails has built-in support for testing, making it easier to write and run unit tests, integration tests, and system tests.

## Benefits of Using Ruby on Rails

*   **Rapid Development:** Rails' conventions and tools enable developers to build web applications quickly.
*   **Large Community:** Rails has a large and active community, providing ample resources, support, and open-source libraries (gems).
*   **Code Reusability:** The DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle is central to Rails, promoting code reusability and reducing redundancy.
*   **Easy to Learn:** Ruby is a relatively easy language to learn, and Rails provides a well-structured framework, making it accessible to new developers.

## Example

Here's a simple example of how you might define a model in Rails:

```ruby
# app/models/product.rb
class Product < ApplicationRecord
  validates :name, presence: true
  validates :price, numericality: { greater_than_or_equal_to: 0 }
end
```

This code defines a `Product` model with validations for name and price.

## Conclusion

Ruby on Rails is a powerful and versatile framework that can be used to build a wide variety of web applications. Its emphasis on convention over configuration, its MVC architecture, and its many built-in features make it a popular choice for developers who want to build web applications quickly and efficiently.
